# 🛡️ SQL Injection Prevention in Hotel Booking API

## Summary

Your Hotel Booking API now has comprehensive security measures to prevent injection attacks and other common vulnerabilities. Here's what we've implemented:

## 🎯 What is SQL/NoSQL Injection?

**SQL Injection** is an attack where malicious SQL code is inserted into application queries to:
- Bypass authentication
- Extract sensitive data
- Modify or delete data
- Execute administrative operations

**NoSQL Injection** is similar but targets NoSQL databases like MongoDB using operators like `$ne`, `$gt`, `$regex`, etc.

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Strong Password Hashing** (`Security/PasswordHasher.cs`)
- Uses PBKDF2 with SHA-256
- Random salt generation
- 10,000 iterations
- Constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks

### 2. **Input Validation** (`Security/InputValidator.cs`)
- Username format validation
- Password complexity requirements
- MongoDB ObjectId validation
- Input sanitization

### 3. **Security Middleware** (`Security/SecurityMiddleware.cs`)
- Detects suspicious patterns
- Basic rate limiting
- Security headers
- Request size limits

### 4. **Demo Controller** (`Controllers/SecurityDemoController.cs`)
- Shows vulnerable vs. secure implementations
- Demonstrates attack patterns
- Educational examples

## 🧪 How to Test Security

### 1. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

### 2. Test with Security Script
```bash
./security-test.sh
```

### 3. Manual Testing Examples

#### Test NoSQL Injection (This will be blocked):
```bash
curl -X POST "https://localhost:7137/api/security-demo/secure/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": {"$ne": ""}, "password": {"$ne": ""}}'
```

#### Test Input Validation:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://localhost:7137/api/security-demo/secure/user?username=<script>alert('xss')</script>"
```

## 🔍 Key Security Features

### MongoDB Driver Protection
Your API is already well-protected because:
- **Strongly typed queries**: `_collection.Find(x => x.Username == username)`
- **BSON serialization**: Automatic type safety
- **No dynamic query building**: No string concatenation

### Example: Secure vs. Vulnerable

**❌ Vulnerable (SQL):**
```csharp
var query = $"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}'";
// Attacker input: admin'; DROP TABLE users; --
```

**✅ Secure (MongoDB C# Driver):**
```csharp
await _usersCollection.Find(u => u.Username == username).FirstOrDefaultAsync();
// Type-safe, no injection possible
```

## 📊 Security Assessment

| Protection Level | Status | Implementation |
|------------------|--------|----------------|
| NoSQL Injection | ✅ Strong | MongoDB C# Driver + Validation |
| Password Security | ✅ Strong | PBKDF2 with Salt |
| Input Validation | ✅ Strong | Comprehensive validation |
| Rate Limiting | ⚠️ Basic | In-memory (upgrade to Redis for prod) |
| Security Headers | ✅ Strong | Complete set implemented |
| Error Handling | ✅ Good | Secure error responses |

## 🚀 Production Recommendations

1. **Use BCrypt.Net** for even stronger password hashing
2. **Implement Redis-based rate limiting** for distributed systems
3. **Add comprehensive logging** with Serilog
4. **Set up monitoring** for security events
5. **Regular security audits** and penetration testing

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. Review the security demo endpoints: `/api/security-demo/`
2. Run the security test script: `./security-test.sh`
3. Examine the implementation files in the `Security/` folder
4. Test your own attack scenarios
5. Consider implementing additional security measures for production
